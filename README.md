# Archived Repository
This repository was used to store the core functionality of SADYCOS.
However, the decision was made to include the code directly in the [top-level repository](https://github.com/SADYCOS/sadycos).
Consequently, this repository is obsolete and will no longer be updated.
It is therefore archived and is only kept to enable pulling older commits of the top-level repository.
